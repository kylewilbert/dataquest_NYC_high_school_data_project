# Dataquest Guided Project: NYC High School Data Project
*This is a Guided Project I completed for the Data Analyst/Data Science path on Dataquest. Dataquest does provide solution code that is available while completing this project. As a result, I do not claim that all of this code is mine or original. At times when I got stuck or when my code didn't fit the direction of the guided analysis, I matched their code for the sake of completing the exercise and learning the structure of the analysis.
So while the code is not 100% original or unique, I believe one of the strengths of these projects is that it helps students like me identify business problems where analysis like this can be valuable. As a result, I'm confident that I can adapt this particular analysis to similar business problems I may face in my day-to-day work.*

## Introduction
In this project, we are exploring SAT scores and demographic data from NYC public schools to see if there are any interesting relationships.

### Methods Used
- data cleaning/processing
- exploratory data analysis

### Technologies Used
- Python
    - Pandas
    - Numpy
    - Re
    - Matplotlib
    
## Next Steps
- Determing wheter there's a correlation between class size and SAT scores
- Figuring out which neighborhoods have the best schools
    - If we combine this information with a dataset containing property values, we could find the least expensive neighborhoods that have good schools.
- Investigating the differences between parent, teacher, and student responses to surveys.
- Assigning scores to schools based on sat_score and other attributes.
